- Download the project from (https://github.com/fjplaurr/personalPortfolio) by pressing the green button "Clone or download".
- Unzip the file downloaded.
- Open a Command Line Interface and go to the root file of the project (It is called reactMarkdownPreviewer).
- Type in the Command Line Interface: 'npm install'. An error will occur if you do not have npm installed in your machine. You can donwload it from here (https://nodejs.org/es/download/).
