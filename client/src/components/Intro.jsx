            <p>Hi, I'm Fran, an engineer with full passion for web design and programming.
                I have a strong interest in both Front-End and Back-End and would like to hear from people who share the same interests.
                I always try to get better by paying full attention to details and reading about web languages and frameworks.
                I love making useful products for clients and sharing knowledge with other developers.</p>
